# Create branch
We create a branch so we do not interfere with the master line - the trunk of a tree.

**Note:** It is possible to edit directly in the main trunk, then tell GitHub to create a branch and submit a pull request.

# Add files
You can add files by clicking the plus sign next to the name of the fork - to create directories just type a forward-slash "/" then the file name.

# Once completed with edits/additions
When we are done editing or adding things, we can do a commit. If operating in the main branch (the fork), select create new branch and start a pull request; otherwise, add commit message, then perform pull request manually.

# something
