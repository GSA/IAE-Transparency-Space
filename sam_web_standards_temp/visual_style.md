## Logo & Usage (need approval for public posting)
[insert logo pages from branding style guide]

## Imagery
You have the ability to surf the Internet on multiple devices, with multiple resolutions (low, medium, high, extra high, and so on), and the ability to make the browser almost any size you want. It is disappointing when a site dictates how you should use it or when the graphics are fuzzy because they are not accounting for the resolution capabilities of my display.
 * Use Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) when possible, especially flat artwork
 * Use Portable Network Graphics (PNG) for flat artwork, images with transparency, or photographs
 * Create and save images at 100 pixels per inch and two times the rendered dimensions; this does not apply to SVG
 * Avoid imagery not directly related to the content being presented
 * Avoid clip art style images.

## Animation
The Internet, as a platform, has come a very long way in a very short time, relatively speaking. The modern Web holds few boundaries when it comes to what can be accomplished; however, just because something can be done, does not mean it should be done. 

Gratuitous animations that do not contribute to user feedback and goals become annoying, causing a speed bump. Animated graphics (or static imagery) that does not aid the communication of the content are distracting and make it difficult to navigate the site. The Web, generally speaking, is a silent world.  Sound (even as part of a video) should be optional. 

For each page you should ask yourself, "What is the primary purpose of this page? What is the secondary purpose? What are the tertiary purposes? What is here that gets in the way of those purposes?"

# Components
## Header
The header consists of the branded home button, main navigation, and application navigation elements (only when within an application). The branded home button consists of the transition.SAM.gov logo with a link to https://transition.AM.gov/ allowing users to go to https://transition.SAM.gov from anywhere within the site.

### Unauthenticated
[Unauthenticated variation]

### Authenticated
[Authenticated variation]

### Application Navigation
The application navigation allows each service to create pages within the application's area within transition.SAM.gov. For example, https://transition.SAM.gov/wages/resources would be a page consisting of links to resources related to Wage Determinations and available within the Application Navigation element when a user is anywhere within https://transition.SAM.gov/wages.

## Footer
The SAM Web Standards uses the "big footer" defined by the *US Web Design Standards* as a base.

## Page Templates
### Default
The default page template consists of the Header and Footer with a free-form content area between.

## Form Templates
See the *US Web Design Standards* for form templates related to name, address, sign-in, and password reset ([https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/form-controls/](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/form-controls/)).

### Application Filter
Used on pages where content spans multiple applications wherein a front-end user may wish to include or exclude any of the content related to the applications.

[Need image or live coded result, with technical description]

## Pagination
The pagination element is used in circumstances where the content being displayed within a site area that cannot be fit on one page (search results, for example). If JavaScript is enabled, continuous scrolling methods can be used in place of the pagination element; however, this element should exist in case JavaScript is disabled.

## Widgets
The *SAM Web Standards* uses the ________ standard [link to reference](). "Widgets are an essential aspect of home screen customization. You can imagine them as "at-a-glance" views of an app's most important data and functionality that is accessible right from the user's home screen."

## Confirmation and Acknowledgement
The *SAM Web Standards* uses the alert concepts from the *US Web Standards* as a base.

### Confirmation (prior to action)
Confirming is asking the user to verify that they truly want to proceed with an action they just invoked. In some cases, the confirmation is presented along with a warning or critical information related to the action that they need to consider.

### Acknowledgement (following action)
Acknowledging is displaying text to let the user know that the action they just invoked has been completed. This removes uncertainty about implicit operations that the system is taking. In some cases, the acknowledgment is presented along with an option to undo the action.

## Icons
The application of standard icons follows the guidance of [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/) for common icons.
