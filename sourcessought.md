# GOVERNMENT SEEKS INPUT - ENTITY VALIDATION SERVICES

The Government is seeking to determine the availability of options to perform Entity Validation Services for the express purpose of protecting the integrity of taxpayer's dollars throughout the award process.   The Government recently posted a [sources sought notice](https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=46419b596deed9dd757b2d6729c3a765&tab=core&_cview=0) requesting input from providers with the skill and capabilities to perform Entity Validation Services.  The Government is requesting information about viable alternatives from all sectors.

The Federal Government awarded over $3 trillion dollars in contracts, grants, loans, and other Federal assistance to entities in fiscal year 2016.  The viability of each entity wishing to do business with the Government, or receive assistance from the Government, must be validated prior to its entering into a business relationship with the Government. 

Entity Validation Services include the assignment of a unique identifier and objective verification (validation) of entity-provided information against authoritative sources for data associated with the unique identifier.  Entity Validation Services are based on federal statute and policy regulations.  The unique entity identifier for the Federal Government is currently the Data Universal Number System (DUNS®) number with which entities register in the System for Award Management (SAM).  The unique entity identifier is tied in SAM to the legal entity name, ‘doing business as’ name, and the physical address that corresponds to it.  Entities awarded Federal procurement and grants actions, with limited exceptions, are required to register in SAM.  The information from SAM is used throughout the Government, to include all aspects of the procurement and financial assistance processes.

## Data associated with Entity Validation Services includes: 

•	Government has unlimited right to use, disclose, and share all data associated with the entity, including the identifier, if applicable, and maintains it in perpetuity 

•	All data fields including any provider’s identifier are available for open use and reuse, both domestic and global

•	Allow Government to trace, disclose, and share a detailed hierarchy of entities at all levels 


The Government wishes to determine whether Entity Validation Services are readily available and the extent to which such services may be feasibly implemented.  Specifically, the Government wants to hear:
1.	Are there other services used in industry that would benefit the Government?
2.	What other concepts or processes should the Government be considering in support of improving data transparency?
3.	What innovative approaches are appropriate?
